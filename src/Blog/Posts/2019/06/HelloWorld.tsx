        <p>After a quick look at <a href={'https://www.gatsbyjs.org/'}>Gatsby</a>, I decided to make my website with the technologies I already know.</p>
        <p>Now you may ask yourself why I put "again" in the title and that is ok.</p>
        <p>I already had a little blog and this is a rework. That's the reason.</p>
        <h2>What to expect?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Posts about web development</li>
            <li>Posts about general topics</li>
            <li>Maybe tutorials</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            So far,<br />
